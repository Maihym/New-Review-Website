    "text": "I needed ground wiring done for my newly installed solar on the roof and I felt the solar company was charging way too much to have it done. The company I worked for used First electric to do some wiring in one of our warehouse so I decided to contact Michael at First Electric and I was not disappointed. He gave me a more affordable quote to do it. He was on time and the work was completed in a couple of hours. He also got into contact with the city inspector to make sure the work he did was in compliance. I was fully satisfied with the work and customer service that Michael and First Electric gave me personally. Top notch!",

We searched companies on Yelp and decided to call First Electric after reading many positive comments from customers. Michael responded promptly and provided us with quotes for different options. We didn't have to look any further. We were sold by Michael's demeanor, professionalism and honesty. He started the job in a timely manner and was very thorough making sure every detail was to his and our satisfaction. First Electric is now our preferred choice for all our electrical needs.",

    "text": "Called First Electric on Friday morning and requested him to come and look at my electrical panel.  We met later that day which was perfect timing. He diagnosed the panel and suggested I do a panel upgrade. He flipped the breakers and found one of them arcing with a little flame.  He said he could not leave with electricity connected because of the fire risk. He said he would go home and write up a quote and email it to me that night. His price was so much lower than the quotes I had for a panel replacement.  I agreed to have this done and he said he would order the parts Friday night and pick up the parts Saturday morning and be at my house to do the job around 10:00am.He was here on time and got to work. It took him till about 3:30-4:00pm to complete the job.I highly recommend First Electric for all  your electrical needs.Honest, friendly, and does what he says he will do??MarkBrea CA",

We scheduled an appointment for the following day. He showed up at the precise scheduled time and thoroughly inspected the project and gave me a detailed plan on what was needed. After evaluating several other companies, I decided to go with Michael. His wasn't the most expensive nor cheapest but his professionalism helped make my decision.He pulled the permit and contacted Edison before starting the job. About a week later we scheduled an appointment for installation, most of which was completed the first day. He came back the next to finish up a few things (cleaning the area each day.) He scheduled his patch & repair person in the following days and the final inspection. My only complaint would be that his patch & repair person was not as meticulous about cleaning the area after he finished his job. Otherwise, from start to finish I am pleased with the outcome. I told Michael he's my electrician for life now!! Don't hesitate in hiring him - you won't be disappointed.",

He came over, was super professional, and helped get us to a point where we could safely get the electricity turned back on. He fixed up some of our other wiring issues and gave us a couple quotes for other services (not including the attempted IT help ). He came back a few days later and installed a new microwave for us as ours had also recently gone the way of the dinosaur. Yes the house is apparently falling apart.

I yelped and his business popped up as 24/7 so I reached out and Michael was quick to reply. I shared links/photos of my fans and he was able to provide a quote (fair), contract and same day time slots. Aside me getting lucky with his schedule, he was respectful with my no outdoor shoes inside the house request since I have young children's. He ran into some hiccups during install but quickly resolved with a Home Depot run. Overall I appreciated that he was respectful, well mannered, patient and did quality work. I am particular with aesthetic so he was careful in not damaging the ceiling to the best of his ability instead of glossing over my request.",

He had to make room in my electrical panel and pull about 100 ft of 220 Volt wire. He knew what he was doing and finished my job leaving my place near and clean. He made sure everything was working and even texted me next day to make sure all was well. I am very happy with his service.",

    "text": "Michael at First Electric was very friendly,  personable and kind, a pleasure to \"work\" with.  But it doesn't stop there: he changed out our fluorescent tube's w/ LEDs that are so bright. The first set of lights he ordered he felt were chinsy, so returned them​ for the ones he installed.  The overall cost was also reasonable.   We are very happy customers and would want Michael again if needed.",

    "text": "My elderly in-laws had old florescent kitchen lights that went out. Called several recommended electrical companies. Michael was the only one that came out that same day told us what he could do and gave us a quote. We wanted to change from Florescent to LEDs. He ordered the parts and the following week when the parts came in, he was here and replaced the old lights. The kitchen lights are much brighter and use less wattage. His charge to us (labor and material) was very reasonable and work was done quickly and professionally. Michael has  very pleasant personality and answered any electrical question we had. It was a \"delight\" to have him do the work for us!",

He took the time to explain everything in detail and ensured the job was done right the first time. It's rare to find someone who is both professional and personable, and Michael embodies both.
